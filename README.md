# odin-recipes

This is the first project that I will be doing following the Odin Project

The skills covered here are basic HTML elements and tags

I will also be trying to practice my commit messages skills to ensure that the log will be meaningful

And also practice my command line (shell) skills are practiced by creating, moving, renaming, removing files using the terminal on VS Code
